# SOR-T-SOR-R-Dosimeter-24C16-EEROM-dumper-and-updater.
SOR/T SOR/R Dosimeter 24C16 EEROM dumper and updater. 

Ardiono for STM32 sketch to read and update MGPI Instruments Dosimeters. Tested on the SOR/T will probably also work on the SOR/R and DMC 2000S series devices too. 

Note: you need to dismantle the thing to get at the 24C16 eeprom, and this will both void your warranty, and quite possibly damage 
the device irreprably if you are not extremely carefull since these devices are potted with silicone. Naturaly since I acquired mine on ebay for very little money, and I dont have access to a genuine updater I have no concerns about this.
